## Description 
"Mesto Project Deploy" is a portfolio project created as an assignment for [Yandex.Practicum](https://practicum.yandex.com/web/ "Web Development Program"). 

[Frontend part](https://github.com/daryamakavchik/mesto-project-pair) was implemented together with @yansadykov.

This work was aimed at learning deployment to a remote cloud server. For this, I created a remote server based on Linux Ubuntu at [console.cloud.yandex.ru](https://console.cloud.yandex.ru/) and registered two domains (domain for frontend and subdomain for backend) at [domains.nomoreparties.site](domains.nomoreparties.site). 

What was also done:
* authorization and registration page layout
* connected backend for authorization and registration (from [Backend part](https://github.com/daryamakavchik/mesto-project-backend))
* crash-test entrypoint
* .env files for frontend and backend
* pm2 deployment scenarios
* Firewall and Nginx set up
* SSL certificates (available at both https and http)
