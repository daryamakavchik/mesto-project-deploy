## Description 
"Mesto Project Deploy" is a portfolio project created as an assignment for [Yandex.Practicum](https://practicum.yandex.com/web/ "Web Development Program"). 

[Frontend part](https://github.com/daryamakavchik/mesto-project-pair) was implemented together with @yansadykov.

This work was aimed at learning deployment to a remote cloud server. For this, I created a virtual machine and registered two domains (domain for frontend and subdomain for backend) at [domains.nomoreparties.site](domains.nomoreparties.site). 

What was done:
* added authorization and registration page layout
* connected backend for authorization and registration (from [mesto-backend](https://github.com/daryamakavchik/mesto-project-backend))
* added crash-test entrypoint
* added .env files for frontend and backend
* added pm2 deployment scenarios 
* registered SSL certificates
